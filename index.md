## What is this?
Hi, I'm Denis. A backend engineer and this is an humble attempt to learn something new.

Everything started from [this post](https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/10-portfolio-projects-aspiring-automation-engineers?amp). 
Although I'm not strictly an automation engineer I think every software engineer somehow should try to automate anything they happened to do more than `n` times. Especially when it comes at testing.

In that post [Angie Jones](https://techbeacon.com/contributors/angie-jones) states that is possible, for an automation engineer, to have a portfolio of applications. 

She is right, and it means that a backend engineer can build its own portfolio too.

Here I am, slowing starting with my c.v. as github page while thinking what and how to do it.
